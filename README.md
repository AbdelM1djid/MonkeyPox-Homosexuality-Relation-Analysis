# MonkeyPox-Homosexuality-Relation-Analysis

In the Middle of my MonekyPox Disease analysis , i've Stumbled upon a Video on Youtube Stating that MonkeyPox Disease Spread Mainly Between Homosexual People (Gay Men) 
so i'v Decided to Switch My analysis into a Disease analysis and a Relation analysis between Homosexuality and MonkeyPox , Which turned in the end to give a Positive Relationship between the two 

Biggest Challenges : 
- My Biggest challenges in this analysis was to find Homosexuality Population in Countries datasets which i couldn't  find , instead i found a great alternative and i made good use of that (which is 'Countries Laws against Homosexuality' )
- My second biggest challenge in this analysis was the monkeypox dataset that some important columns such as gender and age had little non missing values , at first i though that was a downside to my analysis , but it turned to be a great clue of the existance of the relationship
To Prove the Relationship i've  : 
- analyzed and understood the MonkeyPox Disease and data 
- aggregated MonkeyPox and Homosexuality Data 
- geographically visualized Number of MP Cases in countries with laws against homosexuality and countries that support it 
- confirm my findings through Statments of World Health Organizations 
To Do that , i used the following skills :
- Analytical Skills 
- Data Proxy 
- Data Aggregation
- Data Processing & Cleaning
- ETL 
- Data Visualizing 
- Data Story Telling and Clear Communication while Proving My insights through True Statements 

To Apply These Skills i used the following tools :
- Excel (Aggregate Data,Visualize MonkeyPox Dataset,Dashboard making, and little bit of Data Structering & Cleaning)
- Microsoft Sql Server (Store Data into Database,Understand Data , Process Data, Change Data Formats,Export analysis tables)
- Tableau (Geographical Visualizations,Dashboard Making , and using a Story Sheet to Communicate Findings and explain the relationship)

Main Files  : 
- Excel Main File in the Data Folder
- Excel Mp & Gay Relationship in the Data Folder
- Sql (Analysis/Cleaning File) in the Sql File & Analysis Files Folder
- Tableau Workbook in the Visualizations Folder
