1# - Prepare The Data : 
        -  Donwloaded the data from Kaggle Platform 
        -  Renamed the CSV File into 'MonkeyPox Csv File'
        -  Imported Csv into Excel Worksheet and Renamed Worksheet into 'Monkey Pox Worksheet'
        -  Made a Copy out of the worksheet to save the original File
        -  Created a Metadata File Containing Description of Data
        -  Imported The Worksheet Copy into Sql to start The Processing and Cleaning Step
        -  Explored Data Columns and The unique Values
        -  Created a Data information File and enriched it with Columns Meanings 

2# - Processing and Cleaning : 
There is so much repetitive operations so i created multiple chunk of codes to check 
the Unique values , change column type , drop rows , drop columns and fill values 
        - Checking Missing Values in each column to decide either to drop/Fill the column/row
        - columns dropped  : Source_V , Source_VI , Source_VII because they contain no value 
        - rows dropped : WHERE ID IS NULL
        - back up data every now and then to avoid repeating the process all over 
        -  transformed 'omit_error' values in the Status column into confirmed if they have a confirmation date otherwise drop them 
        - Checking Number of unique values in each columns to decide if they are useful or not 
        - Drop columns that we don't use for anlysis which are : 
(Country_ISO3,Contact_comment,Contact_ID,Travel_history_entry,
Travel_history_start,Source_II,Source_III,Source_IV,Source_V,
Source_VI,Source_VII,Date_entry,Date_last_modified)


        - changing datetime columns into date only to remove hours from them
        - chaging Date_death into int then into date because the column was in a base date ex : '44270'
        - Checking for Duplicates values in the ID Column and finally creating Metrics to move into the analyzing step
