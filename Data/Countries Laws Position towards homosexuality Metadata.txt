Data integrity  : 
-Dataset provided ILGA Which used to publish maps on Sexual orientation laws every year 
- contains all needed informations for the analysis
- ilga publishes the dataset to defend lgbtq so they provided honest data about countries
that are with and against homosexuality , little do they know what i did with it :) 
Data use  : 
- This Data contains Countries Laws/Position with homosexuality where we can find multiple useful variables to 
- identify the relationship with MonkeyPox and Homosexuality such as : 
-the legality of homosexuality in that country 
 the Penalty applied to homosexuals 
- whether they support same sex marriage or not  . .. . etc 
 
i will run an analysis with aggregation of the MonkeyPox dataset to find if the countries that support/don't support 
homosexuality has High/Low MonkeyPox Cases
